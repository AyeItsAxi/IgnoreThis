### GM_Construct
A remake of GM_Construct using Fortnite assets for 7.30 and 7.40!

- Load into it by pressing f3 on the gamemode select screen. On 7.40 you will need to type the command `streammap athena_terrain` once loaded in. If that doesn't work just type in `streammap /Game/Athena/Maps/gm_construct`

- This mod also allows you to spawn in STW husks and BR fiends! Press numpad 0 on your keyboard to give yourself 1000 health and 500 shield and enable damage, note that if you die you must reload the map.

Spawn commands:
- Old Blaster before S8
`cheatscript giveitem WID_BlasterSpawner`
- Unused STW version of the BR Brute
`cheatscript giveitem WID_BruteSpawner`
