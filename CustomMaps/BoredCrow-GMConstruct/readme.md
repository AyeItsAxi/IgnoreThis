### GM_Construct
A remake of GM_Construct using Fortnite assets for 7.30 and 7.40!

- Load into it by pressing f3 on the gamemode select screen. On 7.40 you will need to type the command `streammap athena_terrain` once loaded in. If that doesn't work just type in `streammap /Game/Athena/Maps/gm_construct`

(This mod was included in the initial launch of Rift Marketplace v2. Made by boredcrow24#6742)
